# Airline-Data-Analysis-Project
## Abstract
The "Airline Data Analysis" project involves leveraging data analytics techniques to enhance the operational efficiency, customer satisfaction, and financial performance of a commercial airline. Through the examination of flight schedules, passenger bookings, and other relevant data sets, the project aims to optimize scheduling, improve the passenger experience, and make strategic decisions for revenue growth and cost reduction. Utilizing SQL, Python, and machine learning, this analysis provides actionable insights for stakeholders, contributing to data-driven decision-making in the dynamic aviation industry.


## Business ProblemÂ¶
Our company has been providing high-quality air transportation service to our clients for several years, ensuring a safe, comfortable, and convenient journey for our passengers. We operate a diverse fleet of aircraft, ranging from small business jets to medium-sized machines. However, we currently face challenges due to various factors such as stricter environmental regulations, higher flight taxes, increased interest rates, rising fuel prices, and a tight labor market leading to higher labor costs. These challenges are putting pressure on the company's profitability, and we are actively seeking solutions to address this issue. In order to tackle this challenge, the company is planning to analyze their database and identify opportunities to increase the occupancy rate, thereby boosting the average profit earned per seat.

## Challenges
1.	Stricter environmental regulations: The airlines industry is facing increasing pressure to reduce its carbon footprint, leading to the implementation of more stringent environmental laws. These regulations not only raise operating costs but also restrict the potential for expansion.
2.	Higher flight taxes: Governments worldwide are imposing heavier taxes on aircraft as a means to address environmental concerns and generate revenue. This increase in flight taxes has raised the overall cost of flying, subsequently reducing demand.
3.	Tight labor market resulting in increased labor costs: The aviation sector is experiencing a scarcity of skilled workers, leading to higher labor costs and an increase in turnover rates.

## Objectives
1. Increase occupancy rate: By increasing the occupancy rate, we can boost the average profit earned per seat and mitigate the impact of the challenges we're facing.
2. Improve pricing strategy: We need to develop a pricing strategy that considers the changing market conditions and customer preferences to attract and retain customers.
3. Enhance customer experience: We need to focus on providing a seamless and convenient experience for our customers, from booking to arrival, to differentiate ourselves in a highly competitive industry and increase customer loyalty.
The end goal of this task would be to identify opportunities to increase the occupancy rate on low-performing flights, which can ultimately lead to increased revenue for the company.

## Basic Analysis
The basic analysis of data provides insights into the number of planes with more than 100 seats, how the number of tickets booked, and total amount earned changed over time, and the average fare for each aircraft with different fare conditions. These findings will be useful in developing strategies to increase occupancy rates and optimize pricing for each aircraft. Table 1 shows the aircraft with more than 100 seats and the actual count of the seats.
